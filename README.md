Communication over a local network using MKR1000

# What you need:
2 x Arduino/Genuino MKR1000 (code will likely work on other wifi connected Arduinos)

2 x breadboards

1 x button

1 x 220 ohm resistor

1 x 1K ohm resistor

1 x vibration sensor breakout (or any binary style sensor)

1 x dose of forgiveness for my limited coding ability
